backup-mysql-db-script
======================

I got worried about having a corrupt database with no back up, so I created a BASH script.

It's a really static version with no variables, but it works if you need it.

The word "month" is implying that you have this script run on a monthly basis using cron jobs.

If I have time, I'll make it more dynamic.

You can use this script however you want, I just hope it would help others write their backup scripts.
